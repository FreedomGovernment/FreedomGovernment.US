# free.us

free.us is a recreation of the United States Federal and State governments.

## Roadmap

This is a new project and our beachhead project is to recreate one City, one State, and the Federal Government, starting with Eugene, Oregon. After this we will create one GitHub organization per government, State/Province, and country. At some point the entire world will catch on and we'll replicate the projects for each country.
